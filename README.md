# Football Match Results Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This data analysis project explores historical football match results to uncover insights into team performance, home advantage, and scoring trends over time. The analysis is conducted using Python and its powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goals of this analysis are to:
*   Quantify the **home-field advantage** in football.
*   Identify **teams with the highest offensive output** (goals scored).
*   Analyze the **evolution of scoring trends** across different seasons.

## 📊 Dataset

The analysis is performed on a dataset containing historical football match results.

Original Dataset Name: Football - FIFA World Cup, 1930 - 2022

Source Platform: Kaggle

Original Author: Petro Ivaniuk


**Key Columns Used:**
*   `home_team`: Name of the home team
*   `away_team`: Name of the away team
*   `home_score`: Goals scored by the home team
*   `away_score`: Goals scored by the away team
*   `Date`: Date of the match
*   `Year`: Year the match was played

## 🔍 Analysis & Key Questions

The project is structured to answer the following questions:

1.  **Home Advantage**:
    *   How often do home teams win compared to away teams and draws?
    *   What is the win/draw/loss distribution for home sides?

2.  **Team Offensive Performance**:
    *   Which teams have the highest average goals scored per game?
    *   Who are the most potent attacking sides?

3.  **Temporal Trends**:
    *   How has the average number of goals per game changed over the years?
    *   Is the game becoming more or less offensive?

## 📈 Visualizations

The repository includes the following key visualizations to communicate the findings effectively:

*   **Bar Chart**: Compares the number of Home Wins, Away Wins, and Draws, providing a clear visual of the home-field advantage.
*   **Line Chart**: Tracks the average number of goals scored per game per year, revealing long-term trends in match offense.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Python
*   **Libraries**:
    *   `pandas` - for data manipulation and analysis
    *   `numpy` - for numerical operations
    *   `matplotlib`  - for creating static visualizations
